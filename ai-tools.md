# 1. Sora
OpenAI has introduced a remarkable text-to-video model called Sora. This AI model can create realistic and imaginative scenes based on text instructions. Here are some examples of what Sora can do:

Stylish Woman in Tokyo: Imagine a stylish woman walking down a Tokyo street filled with warm, glowing neon lights and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, black boots, sunglasses, and red lipstick. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about. Sora can bring this scene to life in a video format.
**Sora, the text-to-video model, can generate videos up to a minute long while maintaining visual quality and adhering to the userâ€™s prompt.**
