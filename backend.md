# 1. what is difference between microservice and api
The difference between a microservice and an API is primarily in their roles within software architecture:

- **Microservice**:
  A microservice is a small, autonomous service that is part of a larger microservices architecture. Each microservice is self-contained and implements a single business capability. It operates as a component within a system, focusing on doing one thing well and communicating with other services to form a complete application¹².

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**:
  An API is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data formats that applications use to communicate with each other. While an API can be used to expose a microservice, it is not limited to this role and can serve as the interface for any software component¹².

In essence, microservices are components of an application's backend, whereas APIs are the interfaces through which services, including microservices, are accessed and interacted with. APIs can be considered the 'messengers' or 'connectors' that allow different software components, including microservices, to communicate¹².
