# Preparing for a Firebase technology interview involves understanding its core services, architecture, and common use-cases.
Here's a brief overview to get you started:

**Core Services of Firebase:**
- **Firebase Analytics:** Tracks user behavior.
- **Cloud Firestore:** A NoSQL database for real-time data storage and syncing.
- **Firebase Authentication:** Backend services for user authentication.
- **Cloud Functions:** Serverless backend functions responding to Firebase service events.
- **Firebase Hosting:** Fast web content delivery through Google's global network caching.
- **Firebase Storage:** Stores user-generated content like images and videos.
- **Machine Learning Kit:** On-device solutions for text recognition, face detection, etc.

**Firebase Authentication:**
It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. When a user logs in, they receive a JWT, which is then sent with subsequent requests. The server verifies the JWT signature to grant or deny access.

**Interview Preparation Tips:**
- Dive deep into Firebase documentation and resources.
- Gain practical experience by creating a small project or contributing to open-source projects that use Firebase.
- Practice common scenarios you might encounter during the interview.
