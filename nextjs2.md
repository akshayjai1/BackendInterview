# 23. Routing in Next.js is primarily file-system based, meaning that it uses the file structure within the `pages` directory to automatically create routes for your application. Here's a quick overview:

- **File-Based Routing**: Each `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file under the `pages` directory corresponds to a route based on its file name. For example, `pages/about.js` would be accessible at `/about`.
- **Dynamic Routes**: You can create dynamic routes by adding square brackets to a page name, like `pages/posts/[id].js`. This allows you to capture values from the URL to be used in your page.
- **API Routes**: Next.js also supports API Routes, which let you build server-side APIs directly within your Next.js app.
- **App Router**: Introduced in version 13, the App Router supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more. It works in a new directory named `app`.

Server Actions in Next.js 14 integrate with this routing system by allowing you to handle form submissions and data mutations securely on the server side¹²³⁴.
